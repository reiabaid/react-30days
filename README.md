# React in 30 days


This repository contains a 30-day self-driven challenge to build 30 React mini-projects. The goal is to learn React deeply through hands-on practice; one project per day.

##  Objective

- Strengthen React fundamentals (JSX, components, props, hooks)
- Build real-world interfaces
- Learn modern styling with Tailwind CSS
- Understand React Router, API integration, and component architecture
- Finish with a deployable portfolio site
